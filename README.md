## Introduction
> The Methods of Solving Systems of Linear Equations are used in many fields of science.
> The Methods are divided into two basic type, iterative methods which uses initial value to generate
> the first vector of approximate solution and n-th vector of solution is used to make n+1-th vector of mare approximation solution.
> The second type is direct method which theoretically gives us precise solution, but because of the numerical error it's rarely give us true solution.
> In this project I implemented Jacobi Method, Gauss-Seidel Method, which are iterative methods, and LU Methods, which the exampel of direct method.
### System of Linear
> The figure of System of Linear is **Ax** = **b**
